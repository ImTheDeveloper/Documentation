### **Cold** Wallet Setup(Part 1)

This is the wallet where the MasterNode collateral of 25000 JEW coins will have to be transferred and stored.
After the setup is complete, this wallet doesn't have to run 24/7 and will be the one receiving the rewards.

1. Install and open the Shekel-Qt wallet on your machine.

2. Create a receiving address for the Masternode collateral funds.

   Go to File -> Receiving addresses...
   
   Click **New**, type in a label and press **Ok**.
